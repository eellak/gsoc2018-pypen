# Attack PenTest Tools

A set of simple tools that try to take advantage of any information gathered with the use of our [User Reconnaissance module](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-pypen/tree/master/user_reconnaissance) and [Target System Reconnaissance module](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-pypen/tree/master/target_system_reconnaissance), in order to succeed in some basic attack techniques.

### Setup

You will need to install the necessary python packages through executing  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
To use PyDoS, will also need to install hping3. To do that, execute: `sudo apt-get install hping3` 

### Modules

In this simple tool set one can find the following modules:

* `bruftp.py`  
This module makes use of dictionaries, possibly created in our User Reconnaissance module, in order to bruteforce an FTP connection to a target machine that runs an ftp server. It returns an FTP (ftplib) object in case of a successful connection.  
What is required for this module to run is a file named `user_pass_list.json` (the filename can change through the `params.ini` file) that will contain possible usernames and their respective possible passwords in a valid JSON format.  
**Usage example:** `$ python bruftp.py -domain ftp.target.com`

* `pydos.py`  
A simple Denial-Of-Service module that tries to open a large number of connections to a service running on port that has been found to be open. The parameters *-sleep* and *-conns* have default values that are defined in the `params.ini` file.   
**Usage example**: `$ python pydos.py -server 192.168.1.254 -port 80 -sleep 1000 -conns 10000`

* `pyransom.py`  
A file encryption/decryption module, that uses a hybrid encryption logic (AES & RSA). The purpose of this is to prove that a system has been found to be vulnerable to an attack. With the use of the AES encryption key, the initialization vector binary file (`iv.bin`), the RSA private key and the same Python module, the target system can recover all possibly encrypted files. The type of the files that we want to encrypt, as well as the names of the encryption keys are defined in the `params.ini` file. If the *-enc* option is set to 1, then the encryption procedure is executed, else if it's set to 0, the decryption takes place.  
**Usage example**: `$ python pyransom.py -enc 1`
